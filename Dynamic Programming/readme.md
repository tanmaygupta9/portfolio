This folder contains the code and report for a project on numerically solving a representative household's consumption/capital holding/saving optimization problem in the neoclassical economic framework. It uses dynamic programming in python and tries to implement computationally efficient ways of solving the problem using value function iteration. 

There are two files: 
1. A python file with the code 
2. A PDF with the report on the different algorithms.
