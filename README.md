# Portfolio
A collection of my data science, econometrics, and ML projects 

More specifically, this repository includes: 

1. My project looking at the causal impact of the State of Bihar (India) repealing the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act in 2006 on night lights and labor market outcomes, done for Applications of Econometric and Data Science Methods at UChicago. Code files and PDF are in the folder 'Bihar NL Project'. Done in collaboration with my classmate Ana Rath. 
2. My project on Machine Learning methods in Two-Stage Least Squares IV estimation, and the application of Random Forests to Steven Levitt's study on police and crime. Code files and PDF are in the folder 'Random Forest IV'. Done in collaboration with my classmates David Tang and Shopnavo Biswas.
